# Can of Books - Front End

**Author**: Tracy Oakley & Jason Christopher
**Version**: 1.0.3

## Overview

App allows user to pull books from a database and display their title, description, and status.

## Getting Started

User just needs needs to navigate to the home page to display all books.

## Architecture

When the client navigates to the Home page, the app contacts the server, which in turn contacts Mongo to pull all the books and their data to be displayed to the client.
