# Can of Books - Front End

**Author**: Tracy Oakley & Jason Christopher
**Version**: 3.0.2

## Overview

App allows user to pull books from a database and display their title, description, and status. Also allows user to add, modify, favorite, or delete books from the database.

## Getting Started

From the Home page, the user can select the Add Book button to add a book. Then, in the carousel, the user may select the Modify Book or Remove Book button to update or remove the desired book from the database. The user may also select the heart icon to make the book a favorite.

## Architecture

When the client navigates to the Home page, the app contacts the server, which in turn contacts Mongo to pull all the books and their data to be displayed to the client. When as book is added, a POST request is sent to Mongo via the database. Likewise, when as book is deleted or updated, a DELETE or PUT request is sent to Mongo via the database.
